    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tostones are a popular Caribbean dish made from green plantains that are sliced, fried, flattened, and then fried again until golden and crispy. They are typically served as a side dish or appetizer, often accompanied by garlic sauce, mayo-ketchup, or other dips. Tostones have a crunchy texture and a slightly salty, starchy taste, making them a staple in Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban cuisine.</p>
