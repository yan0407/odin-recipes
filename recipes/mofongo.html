    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mofongo is a traditional Puerto Rican dish made from mashed fried green plantains, garlic, pork cracklings (chicharrón), and sometimes broth or butter for added moisture and flavor. It is typically shaped into a mound and served as a side dish or as a main course, often accompanied by meat, seafood, or a rich sauce. Mofongo has a savory and slightly crispy texture, with a deep, garlicky taste that highlights the flavors of the Caribbean. Variations of mofongo can include different proteins, such as shrimp, chicken, or beef, making it a versatile and beloved dish in Puerto Rican cuisine.</p>
