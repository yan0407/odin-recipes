    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yellow Plantain Pie (Pastelón de Plátano Maduro) is a Puerto Rican and Dominican layered casserole made with sweet ripe plantains, ground beef (picadillo), and cheese. It is often referred to as the Caribbean version of lasagna, with the sweet plantains replacing pasta sheets. The dish is a perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors, as the caramelized plantains contrast with the well-seasoned beef filling. Pastelón is typically baked until golden and served as a main course, making it a favorite comfort food in Latin American cuisine.</p>
